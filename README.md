 
Loan Prediction is a Python-based machine learning project that leverages a Random Forest algorithm to predict loan application approval or rejection. The project encompasses the complete machine learning lifecycle including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization. It provides both a trained model file and a web application interface for making predictions based on customer demographic and financial data.

### Main Function Points
- Loan approval/rejection prediction using Random Forest algorithm
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- Feature engineering for improved model performance
- Model training and evaluation framework
- Result visualization capabilities
- Web application interface (Flask-based via app.py)
- Pre-trained model deployment (Random_Forest.sav)

### Technology Stack
- Python 3.x (100% of codebase)
- Random Forest (Machine Learning Algorithm)
- Flask (Web Application Framework)
- Data processing and visualization libraries (implied in requirements.txt)
